An alternative app for controlling NUX Mighty series guitar amplifiers

This app aims to cover all of the functionality the original app offers plus many enhancements:

• All amps and effects are enabled for all channels.
• Ability to save and recall hundreds of presets locally on your mobile device.
• Improved Jam Tracks functionality. Select any audio file in your device, add preset change events at any point and play along.

The app is open-source. Full code available at https://github.com/tuntorius/mightier_amp
