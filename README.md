# Mightier Amp

An alternative app for controlling NuX Mighty Plug.

## Features
This app aims to cover all the functionality of the original app plus many enhancements:
- All amps and effects are enabled for all channels.
- Ability to save presets locally on your mobile device.
- Improved Jam Tracks functionality. Select any audio file in your device, add preset change at any point and play along.
Note: The app is Android only because Apple will never let an app that controls external hardware on their store, if it's not developed by the original company!
