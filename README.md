# Mightier Amp

An alternative app for controlling NUX Mighty amps series.

## Features
This app aims to cover all the functionality of the original app plus many enhancements:
- All amps and effects are enabled for all channels.
- Ability to save presets locally on your mobile device and export them to share with others.
- Improved Jam Tracks functionality. Select any audio file in your device, add events like loop points, preset changes and others at any point and play along.

Note that the app is Android only because Apple will never let an app that controls external hardware on their store if it's not developed by the original company!

## Supported Amps

1.Mighty Plug/Mighty Air  
2.Mighty 8 BT*  
3.Mighty 20 BT*/Mighty 40 BT*  
4.Mighty BT Lite*/AirBorne Go*/GUO AN*  

Currently only Mighty Plug and Mighty Air are confirmed as working. Due to similarities I have added the rest of the amps (excluding mighty bass) but they are not tested. Note that the process of loading/saving onboard presets is different in each model, so this functionality is disabled for amps in groups 2,3, and 4.
