# Mightier Amp

An alternative app for controlling NUX Mighty amps series.

## Features
This app aims to cover all the functionality of the original app plus many enhancements:
- All amps and effects are enabled for all channels.
- Ability to save presets locally on your mobile device and export them to share with others.
- Remote control using a MIDI controller or a HID device. Both USB and Bluetooth MIDI controllers are supported
- Improved Jam Tracks functionality. Select any audio file in your device, add events like loop points, preset changes and others at any point and play along.
- Various other enhancements

## Supported Amps

1.Mighty Plug/Mighty Air  
2.Mighty 8 BT*  
3.Mighty 20 BT*/Mighty 40 BT*  
4.Mighty BT Lite*/AirBorne Go*/GUO AN*  

Currently only Mighty Plug and Mighty Air are confirmed as working. Due to similarities I have added the rest of the amps (excluding mighty bass) but they are not tested. Note that the process of loading/saving onboard presets is different in each model, so this functionality is disabled for some amps.

## iOS Support
Unfortunately there is no iOS version at this time. I would really like to be able to build one but there are 2 reasons this can't happen right now:
1.I don't have the hardware. Apple doesn't let people develop iOS software on other platforms. Buying a mac, an iPhone and also paying 99$ per year for a developer account for the sole reason of publishing this app seems too much of an investment for me.
2.There is a high risk that Apple will reject the app since it's a 3rd party app that controls a product made by another company that has already provided a companion app. As an example there is another 3rd party app similar to mine - Katana Librarian. It also doesn't have an iOS version.
